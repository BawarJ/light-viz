## LightViz ##

### Goal ###

Provide a tailored user interface for Scientific Visualization using ParaViewWeb as backend.

## Installation

```
$ npm install -g light-viz
```

After installing the package you will get one executable **LightViz** with
the following set of options.

```
$ LightViz

  Usage: LightViz [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                output usage information
    -V, --version             output the version number
    -p, --port [8080]         Start web server with given port
    -d, --data [directory]    Data directory to serve
    -s, --server-only         Do not open the web browser

    --paraview [path]         Provide the ParaView root path to use

    --data-analysis           Inspect data directory and compute metadata
```

## Development

To start developing light-viz, first clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Kitware/light-viz.git
```

To set up the dependencies for light-viz run the following.  Note that this must be re-run every time
the dependencies for light-viz are modified.

```sh
$ npm install
```

When first setting up light-viz for development, it may be helpful to have npm
install a symlink to the latest version that can be executed from the command line
in the folder (presumably in the path) where npm is located.  To do this run:

```sh
$ npm link
```

Now make changes and see what happens.  If you have changed the python code
that runs on the paraview server side, you will have to re-run the LightViz
executable that is generated by `npm link`.  If you have changed the JavaScript
code, running the following command and refreshing the page should be sufficient.

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Before you commit, please run:
```sh
$ npm run build:release
```
This creates a minified version of the light-viz JavaScript code in dist/LightViz.js
which should be added to your commit.
